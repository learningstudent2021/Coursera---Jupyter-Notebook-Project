# Jupyter Notebook Project

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks focused on extracting and analyzing financial data using various APIs and web scraping techniques. The primary focus is on extracting stock and revenue data for companies such as Tesla and GameStop, and visualizing the data using Matplotlib.

## Notebooks

### 1. Extracting Tesla Revenue Data Using Alpha Vantage API
- **Description**: This notebook demonstrates how to extract Tesla's revenue data using the Alpha Vantage API. The data is then formatted into a DataFrame and displayed.
- **Key Libraries Used**: `alpha_vantage`, `pandas`

### 2. Extracting GameStop Stock Data Using Alpha Vantage API
- **Description**: This notebook demonstrates how to extract GameStop's stock data using the Alpha Vantage API, reset the index, and display the first five rows of the DataFrame.
- **Key Libraries Used**: `alpha_vantage`, `pandas`

### 3. Extracting GameStop Revenue Data Using Alpha Vantage API
- **Description**: This notebook demonstrates how to extract GameStop's revenue data using the Alpha Vantage API. The data is then formatted into a DataFrame and displayed.
- **Key Libraries Used**: `alpha_vantage`, `pandas`

### 4. Plotting Tesla Stock Data
- **Description**: This notebook demonstrates how to extract Tesla's stock data using the Alpha Vantage API and plot the stock price graph using Matplotlib. The graph visually represents Tesla's stock price trend over time.
- **Key Libraries Used**: `alpha_vantage`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`

### 5. Plotting GameStop Stock Data
- **Description**: This notebook demonstrates how to extract GameStop's stock data using the Alpha Vantage API and plot the stock price graph using Matplotlib. The graph visually represents GameStop's stock price trend over time.
- **Key Libraries Used**: `alpha_vantage`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`
